    <h1>About Balloon Bash</h1>

    <p>  
    Balloon Bash is a small, home-grown balloon styling brand run by a couple in Singapore,
    taking our first steps into the balloon business with a lot of heart and passion.
    </p>

    <p>
    What started as a simple idea to create beautiful moments for loved ones has grown into
    a journey of learning, experimenting, and bringing joy through balloons — one event at a time.
  </p>

     <p>
    We believe that celebrations should feel personal, meaningful, and stress-free.
    Every setup we create is done with care, as if it were for our own family or friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    One value we strongly stand by is <strong>respecting our customers’ purchases</strong>.
    Once the setup is completed and paid for, the balloons belong to the customer.
    We do not dismantle or remove balloon decor unless specifically requested.
    This allows our customers to enjoy their celebration for as long as they wish.
  </p>

    <p>
    As a couple-run business, we may be small, but we are sincere in what we do.
    We are continuously improving, listening to feedback, and refining our craft
    so we can create better experiences with every event.
  </p>

    <p>
    Thank you for supporting a small local business and trusting us to be part of
    your special moments.
