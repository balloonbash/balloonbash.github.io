    "review": "We are very happy with the balloon decoration set up by Balloon Bash for my daughter’s 1st birthday! It was very affordable and truly value for money. 
    The team was also very accommodating and did an amazing job bringing my mermaid-theme request to life (exactly like my inspiration photo), especially with the board 
    and balloon arch design. As they were not available on the actual event day, they came by the evening before and managed to complete the entire setup in 
    less than 2 hours, which we really appreciated. Everything turned out so pretty, and many of our guests kept commenting on how beautiful the setup was. 
    Highly recommended and will engage them in the future!",
